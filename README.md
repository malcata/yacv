yacv is Yet Another CV class to support the creation of Résumé / CV in LaTeX.

In the context of the migration of my CV to a better looking and improved version, 
after trying some options available on the internet, I have decided to create a class (and not just a style!) 
to support it.

To include this just add the following or similar to your résumé tex file.

%% my document class for CVs %%<BR>
\documentclass[en]{yacv}

Dependencies
---------

Roadmap

Hope to add support for two columns and landscape down the road.
